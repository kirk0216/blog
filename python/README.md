# Blog
The primary goal of this project is to further develop my familiarity with Python and Flask. 

Secondary goals include:
* Familiarizing myself with deployment via Github Actions
* Familiarizing myself with Python libraries (e.g. SQLAlchemy)
* Expanding upon an existing codebase.

While the initial project followed the [Flask Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/), additional features 
(comments, blog detail view, user profile) have been added. Planned additions include an admin panel, user permissions, tags, and search.
